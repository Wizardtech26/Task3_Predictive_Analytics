# Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be used for **predictive analytics** in resource allocation. Using the [IUSS 23/24 Automatic Diagnosis Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/iuss-23-24-automatic-diagnosis-breast-cancer/data), a **Random Forest Classifier** is trained to predict issue priority levels (high, medium, or low) based on diagnostic features.

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Preprocess data (cleaning, encoding, feature scaling)
-   Train a **Random Forest** model to classify issue priority
-   Evaluate performance using **Accuracy** and **F1-Score**

## 🧰 Technologies Used

-   Python 3.x
-   pandas, numpy
-   scikit-learn
-   Jupyter Notebook
